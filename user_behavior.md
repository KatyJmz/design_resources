#User Behavior 
Notes on User behavior

####Accesibility

- Think about if we are using enough contrasts for people who is not using the latests monitor technology [^3]

####Ads 
- Most viewed ads are at the bottom of the visible part of the page. Ads that are on the top bottop of the page are viewed more. [^6]

#### The Fold
- If you are assuming people engage above the fold as a lot of design literature will tell you, you’re likely wrong. More engagement happens right at and below the fold than above [^5]

 
####Loading time

- Studies show that consumers’ average waiting patience (for a page load) is 2 to 4 seconds. Above that range, the abandonment rate rises exponentially.[^2]

####Registration
- Shoppers have many reasons to dislike or dread site registration. They may not plan to return to the site again, making a one-time purchase or a gift purchase. They may dislike registration in general, frustrated with remembering usernames and passwords for all the sites they visit. Some shoppers don’t want a site to save personal information and assume that if they register for the site, the information will be saved. Many users associate registration with getting unwanted email, and for good reason, since many sites offer tiny preselected checkboxes to sign up for email newsletters.[^7]
 
  
####Search 
- **Search Auto-Complete** <br /> People type considerably slower than they read (Search Auto-Complete).[^1]

####User Sessions
- In fact, the average mobile session duration is 72 seconds. In comparison, our own studies show that on desktop, the average session is 150 seconds: more than twice as large. [^4]
